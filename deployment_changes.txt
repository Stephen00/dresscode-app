List of deployment changes

se02-main/back-end/dresscode/settings.py
	Change ALLOWED_HOSTS list to only include the localhosts (localhost/127.0.0.1) and the site you want to deploy from e.g (dresscode.com, dcode.com, www.dresscode.com...)
	Change CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST list to only include the urls of places you want to allow to interact with your site
	There are heroku set up changes at the end, they are protected by a check and won't execute unless in heroku. If deploying on another host we would need to change it to work with that host
	
se02-main/client-app/src/app/api/agent.ts
	Change proxy to point to the back-end hosting site - For local deployment it should be either http://127.0.0.1:8000 or http://localhost:8000

se02-main/back-end/requirements.txt 
	We installed some packages which are required for the Heroku version to work
	You can uninstall these packages using the 'pip uninstall django-heroku' command in your command line
	When working with other hosting services you might need to install their equivalent package.
